1. The Story
--------------------------
In the midst of my final semester—when the pressure of exams was overwhelming—I decided to take a creative break. Instead of drowning in endless study sessions, I chose to channel my energy into something that had always been close to my heart: gaming.

Back in the days of eighth grade, I spent countless hours playing Pokémon on a console emulator. Configuring that emulator was a nightmare, and finding ROMs was even harder. Fast forward to today, I wanted to build something that would bring back that nostalgic thrill. I envisioned a web-based console emulator so accessible that even my brother could play online without any downloads.

This project is a labor of love—a tribute to the magical gaming experiences of the past and a celebration of how far technology has come. I poured my heart into creating a solution that not only makes playing Pokémon easier but also rekindles the memories of simpler times. Every feature, from saving your game progress to customizing your controls, is designed to immerse you in that nostalgic joy.
